# Godot-ProcGen-Tests

These are the project files I used when trying out how hard/easy procedural terrain would be in Godot. I've released the project publicly due to popular demand.  

Made using [Godot 3.0 Alpha 1](http://op.godotengine.org:81/downloads/3.0/alpha1/). Previous versions of the Godot engine certainly won't work, later versions might or might not.  

Please note that this code probably isn't optimized the way it should be for an actual game. It's written by me for myself to test out procgen within Godot.  

Currently, I've only implemented midpoint displacement but it should be fairly easy to add other generation algorithms. If anyone would do so, I'd be glad to receive a pull request from you :)  

I've also created an [Imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/xgBL1) containing some screenshots, all of which were generated using this exact code.  

If you have any questions/remarks about this code, feel free to contact me through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zedutchgandalf) or [e-mail](mailto:robin@blueoniongames.com)!
